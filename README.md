Hello!

This is my first official project on github!
With pleasure I present you one of the most advance localhost website in this side of the Internet [joking].

I put this project right here to start making foundation to my future repo, but in this moment it just a simple project in which I've decided to use
frontent tools which I've learned for last couple of months.

In this project I've used:

- html
- webpack
- sass

And below I put a quick installation quide:

1. Download all files form repo,
2. Open this in VS code,
3. Open terminal in Vs ,
4. Write 'npm install' and press enter,
5. Write 'npm run build' and press enter,
6. After complete run, write in terminal 'npm run start:dev',
7. Open your browser (recommended in incognito mode),
8. Write in url bar 'localhost:9000',
9. Enjoy my simple website!
