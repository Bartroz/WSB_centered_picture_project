Hello!

This is my first official project on github! 
With pleasure I present you one of the most advance localhost website in this side of the Internet [joking].

I put this project right here to start making foundation to my future repo, but in this moment it just a simple project in which I've decided to use
frontent tools which I've learned for last couple of months.

In this project I've used:
-html
-webpack
-sass

And below I put a quick installation quide:

1.Download all files form repo
2.Open this in VS code
3.Open terminal in Vs 
4.Write 'npm init' and press enter
5.After that should appear folder named 'dist'
6.Put file 'index.html' to this folder
7.Write in terminal 'npm run build'
8.After complete run write in terminal 'no run start:dev'
9.Open your browser (recommended in incognito mode)
10.Write in url bar 'localhost:9000'
11. Enjoy my simple website!
